# A timer for python nose tests

## nose-timer

@mahmoudimus wrote this timer for nose tests and I want to use it in my projects. So, I'm creating a repository so I can install it with PIP. The original gist can be viewed in all it's glory at https://gist.github.com/848183.

## Install

`pip install -e git+git://github.com/patjenk/nose-timer.git#egg=nose-timer`
